#Python Scripts for DLC Analysis

In this repository are scripts to facilitate the analysis of results from [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut), a markerless pose estimator from the [Mathis Lab](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/).

The script `distance_velocity.py` was used to calculate distance and velocity from videos analyzed using DeepLabCut.

The script `path_tracing.py` was used to generate a figure highlighting animal movement from videos.
